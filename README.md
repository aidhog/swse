# Semantic Web Search Engine (SWSE)

Legacy code. The code was built from the ground up as a distributed system that uses RMI for communication.

The code includes packages for crawling, ranking, reasoning, querying and searching large-scale RDF datasets.

The entry point are the classes in the org.semanticweb.swse.cli.* package, which allows for running RMI servers and invoking them.

Another entry point are the test packages, where one can view small test-cases for individual components.
